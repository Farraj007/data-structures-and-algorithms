# Challenge Summary

create a function called tree_intersection  that takes in two trees and returns a list of all the values that are common between the two trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

You can clearly notice that the code has recursion function being called for every node inside the tree so the time&space is complexity O(n).

## Code

[Code](./tree_intersection.py)
